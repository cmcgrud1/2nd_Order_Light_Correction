# 2nd_Order_Light_Correction
Code used to model and correct for second order light that contaminants stellar spectroscopic images on IMACS

A spectrograph differentiates all the wavelengths of white light via diffraction. That diffraction occurs multiple times, each time with reduced intensity, called 'orders'. To observe exoplanet atmospheres, we observe minute changes in the host stars stellar spectra due to the exoplanet's atmosphere. This When using the Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) mounted on the Baade Magellan telescope to observe stellar spectra for our exoplanet observations,
